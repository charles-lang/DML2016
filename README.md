# DML2016 - Learning Analytics in Informal Spaces

Social Network Analysis

Today we are going to perform a social network analysis on data from an after school program. Please download all the files (as a Zip folder using the green button on top right) in this repository and extract them to a folder on your computer.

Then open RStudio, and go to File -> New Project... -> New Directory -> Empty Project

Navigate to the folder you extracted the downloaded materials to and then click "create project".

Once you have created your project, you should see the files you extracted in the bottom right pane. Click on the "DML2016_instructions.RMD" file
